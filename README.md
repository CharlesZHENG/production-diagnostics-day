### Production Diagnostics Day

This repository contains materials and hands-on labs for a production diagnostics and monitoring workshop. The hands-on labs cover a variety of scenarios ranging from semantic logging and ETW monitoring to dump file generation and automatic analysis.

Before you begin working on the labs, make sure you have the [prerequisite installations](Lab_prereq.md) on your system.
